# Rules:
# For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
# For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
# Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase

#Given these parameters, write a program so that you can figure out how many total bottles of pop can be redeemed given a customer investment.
